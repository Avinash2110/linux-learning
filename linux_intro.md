#### _"Linux by design is a kernel not an operating system"_  

## What is Kernel?  
It is the primary part of the operating system. When a system gets booted, Kernel is the first  
part of the OS which gets loaded in the RAM for your system to start working. It is the core  
interface between a computer's hardware and its processes aka applications to use the hardware.  

### Importance of Linux in DevOps and Cloud.  
* Customization: As you have more freedom and control over operating system functionality and  
can tune it accordingly.  

* Scalability: Linux operating can accommodate larger workloads without hampering the system  
performance beyond acceptable levels. As it successfully supports the concepts such as clustering, multiprocessing, and load balancing.  

* Containerization: Linux laid the foundation of the modern container platform rise. All the  
major concepts of container ecosystem such as packaging and orchestration relies on linux namespace.
